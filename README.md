## General Information
- *Provide general information about your project here.*
  - This is one of several Python processes used in my home automation system (**DIYHA**). I've used OOP, MVC, and MTV concepts in my DIYHA system.
- *What problem does it (intend to) solve?*
  - I wanted to isolate the server information and status into a single process. The main python application subscribes to a **diy/system/who** topic and responds by turning on or off status updates.
- *What is the purpose of your project?*
  - My home automation system contains environment sensors, motion sensors, LED clocks, light switches, emergency sirens, a django web server, interfaces to Adafruit.io and a mosquitto MQTT broker.
- *Why did you undertake it?*
  - This was a fun project to learn about python, Raspberry Pi, Arduino processors, hardware and more.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
## Technologies Used
- python=3.7.3
- Adafruit-Blinka=7.1.0
- paho-mqt=1.6.1
- RPI.GPIO
- digitalio
- adafruit-circuitpython-rgb-display
- python3-pil

## Features
List the ready features here:
- Handles the basic **diy/system/who** function
- Reports on status and diagnostic information for the host raspberry pi server.
- Code passes pylint with a score of 10.0
## Screenshots

## Architecture
This is a application that collects data about the host and potenitally presents information on some type of I2C or SPI bus display device. It posts topic data to an MQTT broker and to a web server. It also uses threads to run time-based, standalone processes.

## Setup
Clone the repository, followed by installation of the dependencies. The last step is to decide on automation.
### Clone the repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/parttimehacker/diyha3-asset.git
cd diyha3-asset
```
### Install dependencies
Note: The Raspberry Pi operating team made a change on pip installations prior to version 12 of Raspian.
- Prior to Raspian 12
```
sudo pip install Adafruit-Blinka 
sudo pip install adafruit-circuitpython-rgb-display
sudo pip install paho-mqtt==1.6.1
sudo pip install RPI.GPIO 
sudo apt-get install python3-pil
sudo pip install psutil
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306
```
- Raspian 12 and later
```
sudo pip install Adafruit-Blinka --break-system-packages
sudo pip install adafruit-circuitpython-rgb-display --break-system-packages
sudo pip install paho-mqtt==1.6.1 --break-system-packages
sudo pip install RPI.GPIO --break-system-packages
sudo apt-get install python3-pil --break-system-packages
sudo pip install psutil --break-system-packages
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306 --break-system-packages
```

## Usage
You need to decide whether you want to manually run the application or have it started as part of the boot process. I recommend making a **Raspbian OS systemd service**, so the application starts when rebooted or controled by **systemctl** commands. The **systemd_script.sh** creates a admin directory in **/usr/local directory**. The application files are then copied to this new directory. The application will also require a log file in **/var/log directory** named asset.log.
### Manual or Command Prompt
To manually run the application enter the following command (sudo may be required on your system)
```
sudo python3 asset.py --m MQTTBROKER --ll LOCATIONTOPIC -w WEBSERVER -d DISPLAY -a APPLICATION
```
- MQTTBROKER is the host name or IP address of MQTT broker. I use the Open Source Mosquitto broker and bridge.
- LOCATIONTOPIC is the MQTT topic name for the location of the server. Usually diy followed by area then the room - diy/upper/study
- WEBSERVER is the host name or IP address of RESTful API web server. I use django to host my local DIYHAS web site.
- DISPLAY is the display type or NA. This version support ssd1306 and st7789 devices
- APPLICATION is the primary application running on this server. If a display is available it will share data from the HOSTAPPLICAION's published topics.
### Raspbian systemd Service
First edit the **asset systemd service** and replace the MQTT broker, room values and django web server with their host names or IP addresse. A systemd install script will move files and enable the applicaiton via **systemctl** commands.
- Run the script and provide the application name **asset** to setup systemd (the script uses a file name argument to create the service). 
```
vi asset.service
./systemd_script.sh asset
```
This script also adds four aliases to the **.bash_aliases** in your home directory for convenience.
```
sudo systemctl start asset
sudo systemctl stop asset
sudo systemctl restart asset
sudo systemctl -l status asset
```
- You will need to login or reload the **.bashrc** script to enable the alias entries. For example:
```
cd
source .bashrc
```
### MQTT Topics and Messages
The application subscribes to two MQTT topics and publishes six status messages. Three are are sent at initialization and then handled by a **diy/system/who** message. Three other messages are sent every 15 minutes after calculating an average. The first three are:
```
self.host = socket.gethostname()
self.os_version_topic = "diy/" + self.host + "/os"
self.pi_version_topic = "diy/" + self.host + "/pi"
self.ip_address_topic = "diy/" + self.host + "/ip"
```
The timed messages are:
```
self.host = socket.gethostname()
self.cpu_topic = "diy/" + self.host + "/cpu"
self.celsius_topic = "diy/" + self.host + "/cpucelsius"
self.disk_topic = "diy/" + self.host + "/disk"
```
- The **diy/system/who** sends local server information to the MQTT Broker. 
## Implementation Status
![Status](https://progress-bar.dev/80/?title=progress)
## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- Further refactoring to more generalize the class

To do:
- Integrate into other DIYHA applications and repositories
- Develop a new installation process for seperate repositories
